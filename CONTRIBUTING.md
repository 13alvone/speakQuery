# Contributing to SpeakQuery

Thank you for considering a contribution.

SpeakQuery values clarity, correctness, and restraint over cleverness.
Contributions should improve real-world usefulness and long-term maintainability.

## Scope of contributions

Welcomed:
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Security hardening
- Documentation improvements
- Tests and reproducible examples
- Clearly motivated feature additions

Discouraged:
- Features that introduce artificial complexity
- Rent-seeking mechanisms or usage restrictions
- Obfuscation or unnecessary abstraction

## Development standards

- Python 3.12.x is required.
- Follow existing code style and naming conventions.
- New functionality must include tests where practical.
- Native / C++ components must be justified and documented.

## Commits and pull requests

- Keep commits focused and logically grouped.
- Write clear commit messages explaining *why*, not just *what*.
- Large or breaking changes should be proposed via an issue first.

## Security considerations

- Do not introduce unsafe file access, directory traversal, or implicit code execution.
- Be explicit about trust boundaries.
- Report security concerns privately if appropriate.
