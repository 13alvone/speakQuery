* Enforced **Python 3.12.x** as a hard requirement (fail-fast with clear remediation + OS-specific install hints).
* Hardened `setup.sh` argument parsing and UX:

  * Added `--python`, `--venv-dir`, `--recreate-venv`, `--skip-dev`, `--wheel-only`, `--allow-source-builds`.
  * Added consistent log helpers and improved error output.
* Improved cross-platform portability (major Linux families + macOS) with best-effort distro detection and actionable dependency hints.
* Added defensive checks for build prerequisites (e.g., warning if `cmake` missing before native builds).
* Made venv creation idempotent and safe (reuse existing env; optionally recreate; verify venv Python is also 3.12).
* Added pip installation controls (optional wheel-only installs; explicit main/dev requirements handling with robust file checks).
* Added `.env` bootstrap logic during setup:

  * Create `./.env` if missing.
  * Auto-generate and persist `SECRET_KEY` if absent (unblocks DB init/import-time Flask config).
* Updated DB initialization path to provide clearer import/traceback context during failures.
* Updated README to reflect:

  * Python 3.12 pin rationale and expectations.
  * New `setup.sh` behavior/options.
  * Correct env var loading order and required vs optional variables.
  * Email alerting behavior change (SMTP vars required only when sending, not at setup/import time).
