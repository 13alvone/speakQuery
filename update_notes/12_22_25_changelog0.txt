SpeakQuery – Project Governance & Security Hardening

Added a clear project ethos emphasizing non-rent-seeking, transparency, and usefulness-first design.

Introduced an explicit Project Philosophy and Authorship section in README.md.

Preserved all existing technical documentation while framing SpeakQuery as authored infrastructure, not a productized service.

Declared Apache License, Version 2.0, with explicit attribution expectations.

Added a standalone NOTICE file for authorship, attribution, and ethos (Apache-conformant).

Created a concise, engineer-focused CONTRIBUTING.md outlining contribution scope, standards, and attribution principles.

Created a lean, professional CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md focused on respect, technical rigor, and integrity.

Added a formal SECURITY.md defining supported versions, responsible disclosure process, security scope, and operational expectations.

Clarified that security is an engineering responsibility and that obscurity-based protection is rejected.

Established SpeakQuery as transparent, auditable infrastructure intended for real-world use without artificial restrictions.
